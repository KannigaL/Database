-- Domain(Student, Department, Program, Branch, Course, Classification, LimitedCourse, WaitingList, Taken)
Domain(idnr, sname, login, department, dabbr, program, pabbr, branch, code, credits, cname, classiname, capacity, position, grade)

2. Domain description to FD.
Domain(idnr, department, program, dabbr, branch, cname, code, credits, capacity, classiname, position, grade)

3. Decompose the Domain in 1. 
idnr → sname login program branch
login → idnr
department → dabbr
dabbr → department
program → pabbr
code → department credits cname capacity 
idnr code → position grade
code position → idnr

With the following input:
idnr sname login department dabbr program pabbr branch code credits cname classiname capacity position grade
idnr -> sname login program branch
login -> idnr
department -> dabbr
dabbr -> department
program -> pabbr
code -> department credits cname capacity
idnr code -> position grade
code position -> idnr

We get the following keys:
code classiname position

Domain(code, classiname, position).

4. Carefully mark primary keys and all additional keys.
-- UNIQUE constraint in department, student and waitinglist.
